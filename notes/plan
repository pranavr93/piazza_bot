1. Index all the piazza posts in a local index (some ideas - whoosh, elastic search, lucene)
2. Given a new post
	-	If there is already a student or instructor answer, skip the question
	-	Take the subject and body of the question separately 
	-	Subject gives a rough topic of the question
	-	Body gives the more specific form of the question
	-	Take into account the folder/label of the questoin
	-	Overall, 3 features
		-	Subject
		-	Body
		-	Label

Bulk fetch and incremental updates
-	First time jarvis bot runs, it fetches all content (marks them as read along the way)
-	Along the way, it also marks the posts as read
-	Incremental update happens through the filter "update" to get only those posts that have changed since you last read them
-	This way, we can keep the local index up-to-date
